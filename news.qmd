## Workshops & Talks

**Workshop on Measurement Invariance Testing**

On September 28 2025, David and Philipp offer a pre-conference workshop at the FGME 2025 in Berlin with the title *New Perspectives on Measurement Invariance Testing*.
The workshop will cover both newly developed methods for measurement invariance exploration and a causal framework of invariance analyses.

**Workshop on New Methods for Model Fit Evaluation in SEM**

On September 21 2025, Melanie and David offer a pre-conference workshop at the DPPD 2025 in Kassel with the title *Established and innovative methods to evaluate model fit in structural equation modeling*. This workshop introduces new strategies to evaluate model fit in SEM including dynamic fit cutoffs (McNeish \& Wolf, 2023) and machine learning based approaches (Partsch \& Goretzko, 2024/under review).

**Workshop on Machine Learning Methods for Modeling in Psychology**

As part of the *Statistical Modeling in Psychology* (SMiP) Summer School 2025 (30/06/2025 - 04/07/2025), David and Philipp will provide a workshop on machine learning modeling with a focus on its applicability to psychological research and assessment. Besides covering general aspects of machine learning, approaches for interpretable machine learning and cost-sensitive learning are discussed in the workshop. More information can be found on the [SMiP hompage](https://www.uni-mannheim.de/smip-summerschool/workshops/machine-learning-methods-for-modeling-in-psychology/).

**Introduction to Machine Learning at the University Trento (Department of Psychology and Cognitive Science)**

On Tuesday, May 27 2025, David will give an *Introduction to Supervised Machine Learning in Psychology* at the University of Trento. The talk (+ workshop-style exercise) will focus on key concepts of machine learning modeling - such as resampling strategies, hyperparameter tuning, and performance evaluation. More information can be found on the [website](https://beyond.dipsco.unitn.it/home-page) of the University of Trento .
