By integrating various nuisance parameters (e.g., sample and model size) as features in the prediction model, the new approach promises to consider their interactions with model fit indices. Accordingly, the ML-based model fit evaluation addresses shortcomings in the current practice that often relies on simple rules of thumb combining fixed cutoffs and model fit indices.\n\n\n\nFigure 1: Abstract visualization of a tree-based ML approach taking different nuisance parameters into account when identifying model misspecifications in SEM.

Our goal is to improve psychological measurement by combining psychometric approaches and latent variable modeling with modern machine learning and data science tools. Our research addresses different issues related to the measurement of latent variables such as dimensionality assessment, measurement invariance, model fit evaluation, model specification, fairness, and replicability or generalizability.\nOur lab unites psychologists, statisticians, and methodologists who share an interest in measurement topics, latent variable modeling, and psychometrics as well as computational statistics, machine learning, and data science.\nIf you are interest in collaborating, a research internship in our lab, or exchanging research ideas more generally, feel free to contact us."
